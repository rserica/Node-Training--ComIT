// Define a number variable and assign the following value: 10
let number = 11;
// If number is even then show the following message: %number% is an even number
(number%2 == 0) ? console.log(`${number} is an even number` ):console.log(`${number} is an odd number`)

// Try changing the value to an odd number to see what happens
